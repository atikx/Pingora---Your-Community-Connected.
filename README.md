## My thoughts on Completion

I have completed the project till STAGE-4 (which was the final stage) with implimenting each and every task mentioned in each stage.

I have tried my best to follow all the mentioned good practises but I sill messed up with maintaining proper git comments and code uploads. I was supposed to use conventional commits but I didnt used them till half of the project. 

But I think I have done the best I can considering the time (because I was also having CRUX inductions along with this induction)
